### Stack Overflow banning and adopting AI at the same time (ChatGPT)
<p style="border: 2px solid silver; box-shadow: -15px -15px #9a58b5; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;"><strong style="color: #9a58b5">What do you call a programmer who claims they don't use Stack Overflow?</strong><br/>A liar.</p>

- Stackoverflow AI is an AI that can answer questions on Stack Overflow. It is trained on 180 million questions and answers from Stack Overflow. The users are not happy with this as their ability to post answers/comments on Stack Overflow. In fact, Stack overflow has <strong>lost 35% of its traffic</strong> in the past 1.5 years.
- Users also can’t post answers from ChatGPT or other LLMs on Stack Overflow according to the site’s management, citing "<strong>the posting of answers created by ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking questions and looking for correct answers</strong>"
- Users are not happy as they find ChatGPT more convenient which resulted in reduced traffic on stack overflow.
- Read why stack overflow banned GPT: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/gpt-policy" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-generative-ai-e-g-chatgpt-is-banned" target="_blank">here</a>

### Svelte 4 release 
Svelte 4 has been released, primarily as a maintenance update, paving the way for the upcoming Svelte 5, which will involve a complete rewrite of the Svelte compiler and runtime. The changes introduced in Svelte 4 include:
- The Svelte package size has been reduced by almost 75%, from 10.6 MB to 2.8 MB. This reduction leads to shorter waiting times during the npm install process.
- When using cmd+click on Svelte modules, you will now be directed to the implementation instead of a .d.ts file.
- Transitions now have a default |local behaviour, which prevents animations from obstructing page transitions.


<p style="border: 2px solid silver; box-shadow: -15px -15px #9a58b5; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;"><strong style="color: #9a58b5">What is Svelte?</strong><br/> You might have heard of Angular or React as JavaScript frameworks used to build web applications. Svelte is also a relatively new and <strong>growing in popularity</strong> JavaScript framework mostly used to build static web apps. Svelte lets developers write less code and build components using familiar HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also, Svelte apps are truly reactive, which means less hassle as you <strong>don’t need to manipulate DOM</strong>. Svelte uses a compiler which processes the application’s code before emitting a small, fast, and optimized code bundle, so it avoids the overhead of booting or bootstrapping a framework before your code is run in the browser, making execution much faster</p>
